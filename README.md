# Linode Instance Deployment and OpenVPN Setup

This Bash script automates the deployment of a Linode instance and sets up OpenVPN on it securely.

## Usage

### Execution

To use the deployment script, follow these instructions:

1. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script `provision-linode.sh` with optional arguments:

   ```bash
   ./provision-linode.sh [OPEN_VPN_FILE] [TERMINATION_INTERVAL_HOURS]


2. **Import the OpenVPN Configuration:**
   - Import the generated OpenVPN configuration file (`[OPEN_VPN_FILE].ovpn`) into your OpenVPN client.
